# Tech Blog

Created a dynamic website that follows client-server architecture, where a user can log in, register, write 
blogs and comments, and give like if they like any post, also they can see only those posts based on 
category, and the user can edit his profile, update the photo of the blog, and update the photo. We provide 
a user-friendly interface where the user gets a sweet alert for successful upload on the same page.
