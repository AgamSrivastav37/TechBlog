# Tech Blog
## User-friendly TechBlog where programmers and people share their blogs related to new technology and experiences.
Created a dynamic website that follows client-server architecture, where a user can log in, register, write blogs and comments, and give like if they like any post, also they can see only those posts based on category and the user can edit his profile, update the photo of the blog, and update the photo. We provide 
a user-friendly interface where the user gets a sweet alert for a successful upload on the same page.
